## Inspiration
We realized that some people are afraid to watch movies because of the uncertainty of experiencing an epileptic seizures. Movies nowadays have warnings of violence or sexual content but oftentimes, it lacks warnings of bright and flashing lights which pose a serious health risk for some people.

## What it does
Flashguard provides users with information regarding movies that contain flashes or strobing lights. Users can now make an informed decision on what movies they can watch.

## How we built it
-   React.js
-   Chrome Extension (HTML, CSS & JS)
-   API (Does the Dog Die API v1.1.)

## What's next for FlashGuard
- Gaze Tracking
  -  Contacts nearby people or emergency contacts if the user 
      gets into seizure 
  -  Asks for hand gestures in case of false positives
  -  Done local to ensure privacy and security
- YouTube Add-on
  - Detects if a YouTube video has any flicking images
  - Uses frame by frame analysis by comparing its luminosity
- Crowdsourcingâ€‹
  - Collects and reflects data given from platform users
  - Further increasing accuracy by using two data sets
